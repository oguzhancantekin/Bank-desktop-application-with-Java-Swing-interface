# Bank-desktop-application-with--Java-Swing-interface
 What I want to do in this project is to improve my knowledge of Swing, Java, OOP and design. And I used many components in this project and thanks to this, I learned the Swing interface and its usage by applying it. As a result, there is a login screen and a registration screen, you cannot log in to the system without registering except for your number and password, and when you register, this information is added to the system and you are now allowed to log in. I kept customer information here with two different approaches. The first was to create a matching mechanism using a hashmap and the registered customer information was stored as a hashmap. The second thing I did was to use a database, for this I connected to mysql and kept the customer information that is not constantly deleted there. After entering the account, there are many different screens such as depositing and withdrawing money and as a result, the money in the account increases or decreases. I used many classes in this project and again designed according to OOP rules.
